This program implements a dictionary using a hash table (with 1373 buckets, though the dictionary class is more general), and uses it to check a text file for spelling errors (words not in the dictionary). Default dictionary is loaded from "dict.dat" (again, the dictionary class is more flexible with this).

Status: Functioning fully.

Written, compiled, and tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux with GCC 4.9.3
