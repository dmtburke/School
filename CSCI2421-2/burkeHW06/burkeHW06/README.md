Dalton Burke, CSCI 2421 HW 06

This program implements a "dictionary" class that searches and outputs a list of "DictEntry"s using the list structure and iterators and reverse_iterators, and both begin(), end(), and rbegin() and rend() to search it forwards and backwards. Main then shows the result of each of these operations done on information pulled from dictionary.txt and findwords.txt. Sends reverse sorted output to revsorted.txt.

Status: Functioning fully.

Written, compiled, and tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux with GCC 4.9.3 (and emacs)
