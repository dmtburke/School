Developed and tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux with GCC 4.9.3

Scores 204/204.

run make, get the ucd-csci2312-pa2 executable, and then execute that with "./ucd-csci2312-pa2"

note: there is a flag in the makefile (-std=c++11) that I needed to put there so that the "stod" function would work. Don't know why it wasn't available before.
