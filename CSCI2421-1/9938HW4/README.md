Developed and tested on Gentoo GNU/Linux with GCC

File that is read in is "data.txt", I included the file that I was using to test the program during development

The program will make a list of the words you had in the file, then it will ask you for bounds of a sublist (case sensitive!).

After you give it these bounds, it will make a new list, and then sort it alphabetically.

"make" gives you the executable "nodeo", (like a node rodeo!) and to run it you run the command "./nodeo"

"make clean" to clean up the object files and the executable
